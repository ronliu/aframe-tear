A 3D scene displaying a teardrop model. My first A-Frame project after going through an A-Frame tutorial!

Live preview: https://ronliu.github.io/aframe-tear/

What I learned:
- using the background component in &lt;a-scene&gt; is more reliable than making an &lt;a-sky&gt; entity
- converting FBX models into glTF on Linux using Facebook's FBX2glTF (this took way longer than it should've)
- loading glTF models onto A-Frame and animating their position/rotation
- adding background music to a scene
- how to preload assets and customize the A-Frame loading screen

This was a fun project I did with two other friends to practice using A-Frame while they were learning 3D modeling on Blender. We had some trouble with the teardrop material not being transparent after being added to the scene but we suspect that it had to do with Blender's glTF exporter. I also could not figure out how to my audio assets to preload properly so there is a delay before the background music starts playing. Although we ran into a few issues, it came out a lot better than expected and we definitely learned a lot from making this!
